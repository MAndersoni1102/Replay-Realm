# Replay-Realm

## Description

A interactive and dynamic storefront site where customers can view products, select products that interest them which are placed into a list and or cart that the customer can view at the end of their shopping experience and check out.

- We wanted to make something practical with real world use.
- We learned the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Third Party API's, and use of local storage.
